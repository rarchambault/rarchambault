### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roxanne Archambault and I am a Software Engineering Co-op student at McGill University. 

I am passionate about programming and mostly about the logic and creativity it requires to solve complex problems efficiently. I love going through large amounts of code methodically and finding the one place where everything fails!

I also have plenty of other interests, such as literature, arts, music and even space exploration! ðŸš€

You will find here some projects I have worked on throughout my career so far; these are mostly projects I have built in class, working as part of a team. I have also included a few projects I have worked on in some competitons in which I have participated, such as the Engineering Games and the Computer Science Games.

I hope you will find some interesting projects here, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information!

I look forward to working with you! âœ¨
