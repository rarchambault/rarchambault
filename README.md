This web application exposes a REST API interface and uses a Vue.js frontend and a PostgreSQL relational database to provide a website for the McGill Engineering Socials Committee, allowing users to purchase tickets for events and post pictures and messages about them. This was a group project completed in a team of 10 people as part of the course ECSE428 Software Engineering Practice.

### 💵 [**McKrillCroesus**](https://github.com/rarchambault/McKrillCroesus/tree/92515c36b338004adab835f31641d464c24b5dad)

This project, completed as part of the 2023 Computer Science Games, was a challenge to optimize stock market transactions based on a given API and given stock prices. This was completed in a team of two and my team won 5th place for this challenge!

### 🏝 [**McKrillWebMobile**](https://github.com/rarchambault/McKrillWebMobile/tree/37378a742dd76b0c4fd735b63865201db3a58b63)

This project was completed as part of the 2023 Computer Science Games where I implemented, in a team of two people, to implement a web application with a given API. This web application runs on C# and Maui and provides weather information for a paradise island.

### 🏛 [**Museum Software System**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/Museum%20Software%20System)

This project, completed in a team of 6 people as part of the course ECSE321 Introduction to Sofware Engineering, is a web application exposing a REST API interface and using a Vue.js frontend and a PostgreSQL relational database to provide a management system for museum owners wishing to allow their visitors to purchase tickets, view artwork and take art pieces out on loans.

### 🦆 [**RoboDuckies**](https://github.com/WassimJabz/RoboDuckies/tree/e8931298b853999a711a9c258d94c3ed4b2381a9)

This project, completed in a team of 6 people as part of the course ECSE211 Design Principles and Methods, was a robot using a Raspberry Pi and Lego motors and sensors to place foam cubes into a mosaic following an input pattern.
