## About this portfolio

I have included here all the major projects I have worked on in my career so far; feel free to go explore them to understand them in more detail! 

### üåü [**HoloMOTS Demo**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/HoloMOTS%20Demo)

During my internship at the Canadian Space Agency in Fall 2023, I have participated in an intern poster competition which was a presentation to CSA employees to showcase what I did during my internship. Along with my paper poster, I also built a demo application using Unity and C# scripting so that people could try manipulating holograms with the HoloLens2 headset. I cannot provide the code for this application not for the real application I was working on, but you can find a recording I took from the HoloLens2 headset [**here**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/blob/main/HoloMOTS%20Demo/AR%20Poster%20Demonstration.mp4) as well as my [**PDF poster**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/blob/main/HoloMOTS%20Demo/HoloMOTS%20Poster%20-%20Roxanne%20Archambault.pdf).

### ü§ñ [**Engineering Games Machine Competition 2023-2024**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/Machine2024)

This is a robotics project completed to compete in the Machine challenge of the January 2024 Quebec Engineering Games, which is a robotics challenge to be completed over 4 months and showcased at the Games. I was the co-VP Machine for this edition of the competition, meaning I was in charge of the team of 6-20 people (several people contributed to the project, but only a core of 6 people was allowed to work on the robot at the Games. This year's challenge was to build a Mars rover able to pick up plastic balls and place them in tall silos by crossing a 12' x 8' map under an 8" tall platform. The robot runs using a Raspberry Pi using Python code and sereval DC, stepper and servo motors as well as a vacuum to pick up balls.

**Note**: The [**repository**](https://github.com/MachineMGCIL/2023machine) for this project is not public yet.

### üé≠ [**ESCAPE**](https://github.com/rarchambault/ESCAPE/tree/5987d63d12b7c01f064cbe07d0400a38787f277b)

This web application exposes a REST API interface and uses a Vue.js frontend and a PostgreSQL relational database to provide a website for the McGill Engineering Socials Committee, allowing users to purchase tickets for events and post pictures and messages about them. This was a group project completed in a team of 10 people as part of the course ECSE428 Software Engineering Practice.

### üèõ [**Museum Software System**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/Museum%20Software%20System)

This project, completed in a team of 6 people as part of the course ECSE321 Introduction to Sofware Engineering, is a web application exposing a REST API interface and using a Vue.js frontend and a PostgreSQL relational database to provide a management system for museum owners wishing to allow their visitors to purchase tickets, view artwork and take art pieces out on loans.

### ü¶Ü [**RoboDuckies**](https://github.com/WassimJabz/RoboDuckies/tree/e8931298b853999a711a9c258d94c3ed4b2381a9)

This project, completed in a team of 6 people as part of the course ECSE211 Design Principles and Methods, was a robot using a Raspberry Pi and Lego motors and sensors to place foam cubes into a mosaic following an input pattern.

**Note**: The repository for this project is not public yet.

### üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [**DiveSafe**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/DiveSafe)

This project, completed as part of the course ECSE223 Model-Based Programming in a team of 6 people, is a system meant for managing a resort where people can book diving expeditions with guides, rent equipment and plan their trip.

### üíµ [**McKrillCroesus**](https://github.com/rarchambault/McKrillCroesus/tree/92515c36b338004adab835f31641d464c24b5dad)

This project, completed as part of the 2023 Computer Science Games, was a challenge to optimize stock market transactions based on a given API and given stock prices. This was completed in a team of two and my team won 5th place for this challenge!

### üèù [**McKrillWebMobile**](https://github.com/rarchambault/McKrillWebMobile/tree/37378a742dd76b0c4fd735b63865201db3a58b63)

This project was completed as part of the 2023 Computer Science Games where I implemented, in a team of two people, to implement a web application with a given API. This web application runs on C# and Maui and provides weather information for a paradise island.

### üèì [**Pong Game**](https://github.com/rarchambault/pong-game/tree/a6492840e369a51ea266919d5d78d3f7fe41b061)

This project, completed as part of the course ECSE202 Introduction 
to Software Development, implements simple Java classes and a graphical application which simulates a ping pong game where the user plays against a virtual opponent and can choose its difficulty level.
