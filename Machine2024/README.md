# Machine 2024 Engineering Games Challenge

This is a robotics challenge which was part of the 2024 Quebec Engineering Games. Each participating university had 4 months to assemble a team, complete the challenge and showcase the solution at the Games in January 2024. I was the Co-VP Machine of this year's competition, meaning I was in charge of McGill's team for the challenge, and I mostly supervised the controls system implementation.

### The Challenge

This year's challenge was to build a Mars rover able to pick up plastic balls from a specific zone, carry them through a 12' x 8' map and under an 8" high platform, then place them in silos ranging from 8" to 18" in height. More information about the challenge can be found in the official [**handbook**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/blob/main/Machine2024/Machine_Handbook_V0.3.pdf).

### Our Solution

The solution we implemented consists of a Raspberry Pi computer running Python code to control several DC, stepper and servo motors as well as a vacuum to pick up the balls through motor drivers. A more detailed description of our robot can be found in our [**progress report**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/blob/main/Machine2024/Progress%20Report%202024.pdf).

Some photos and videos of our solution are also available [**here**](https://github.com/rarchambault/rarchambault/tree/main/Machine2024/Photos%20and%20Videos).
